For this assignment, you will work in your teams to write a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in C#.
The program will be written in two classes:

1) The “Driver” class (the class with the main method where the program starts) will:
• Welcome the user to the game
• Create a game board array to store the players’ choices
• Ask each player in turn for their choice and update the game board array
• Print the board by calling the method in the supporting class
• Check for a winner by calling the method in the supporting class, and notify the players
when a win has occurred and which player won the game

2) The supporting class will:
• Receive the “board” array from the driver class
• Contain a method that prints the board based on the information passed in
• Contain a method that receives the game board array as input and returns if there is a
winner and who it was

The team will divide itself into half, and one half of the team will work on the driver class, while
the other half of the team will work on the supporting class. Each half will use the Paired
Programming approach, where they work together on the class to solve the problem. The Driver
(the individual at the keyboard) will type, while the Navigator (the other team member) will help
provide overall direction and watch for any potential errors. You can switch those roles at any
time, but both individuals should be working on their program at the same time.

For the purposes of this assignment in trying to help you solidify your understanding of objectoriented programming better, each half of the team will NOT look at the code of the other
half until after the project is functioning. You can communicate as much as you want as a
team to understand what the other half is doing, but do not view or modify any of the code from
the other half while you are building the program.

NOTE: There are numerous examples of a Tic-Tac-Toe program in C# online. You are
welcome to refer to those programs if you get stuck in order to study them and learn, but copying
any of that code would be considered cheating. You must write all the code yourselves.
As always, write good, clean code with descriptive variable names, proper indentation, and clear
commenting to describe what the code is doing.
